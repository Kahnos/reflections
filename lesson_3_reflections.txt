-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's very useful when working in groups or on different computers. 
Even when working alone a remote repository provides a backup in the cloud for extra data protection measures.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic update can overwrite content or a branch without the user consent. 

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch describes a labeled commit. It's useful check out a previous commit and perform changes or new features, separating from the course of the master branch.
A clone means copying a repository locally or from the GitHub server into your machine. 
A fork means copying a repository from GitHub into your GitHub account, recognizing the connection with the original author.
