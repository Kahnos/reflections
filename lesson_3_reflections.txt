-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's very useful when working in groups or on different computers. 
Even when working alone a remote repository provides a backup in the cloud for extra data protection measures.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic update can overwrite content or a branch without the user consent.
