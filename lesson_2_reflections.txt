-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository will create a .git hidden subfolder in the correspondent directory which will contain all the metadata related to it for Git. 

This will allow Git to keep track of the directory as a repository. If you don't do it Git will not keep track of it.
