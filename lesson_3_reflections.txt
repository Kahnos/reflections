-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It's very useful when working in groups or on different computers. 
Even when working alone a remote repository provides a backup in the cloud for extra data protection measures.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic update can overwrite content or a branch without the user consent. 

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch describes a labeled commit. It's useful check out a previous commit and perform changes or new features, separating from the course of the master branch.
A clone means copying a repository locally or from the GitHub server into your machine. 
A fork means copying a repository from GitHub into your GitHub account, recognizing the connection with the original author.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having it locally means you can work on it anytime anywhere without internet connection. 
Also, it's important to know the status of your local repository in regards to the remote (Ahead, behind, etc).

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Github, i worked in person or using Google Docs, sadly this caused much confusion when merging different features or keeping track of versions. Usually i ended up with several directories with a timestamp and no comment.

Github allows structured collaboration via pull requests and branches, it's definitely easier and more organized.
